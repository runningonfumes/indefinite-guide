# The indefinite guide to programming

## About this --book-- repository

This repository is the result of years of frustration as a self-taught 
programmer. I could have a lengthy introduction about my struggles to 
improve myself, about the horrible stuff I saw along the years or about
the mistakes I see repeated over and over again.

But as you probably would skip that stuff anyway, lets get right into it.

`
TL;DR more reference than you would ever care to have
