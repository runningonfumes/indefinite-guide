## Architecture

### The architect

What does an architect do? That's one of the vague things many of use keep wondering 
about. 
Turns out there is more than one architect. Let's start with the enterprise architect.

#### Enterprise Architect

A good start is the talk [Enterprise Architecture = Architecting the Enterprise?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1013&v=DdJNLeYldUs) 
by Gregor Hohpe. Here are the [slides](http://yowconference.com.au/slides/yow2017/Hohpe-EnterpriseArchitectureArchitectingTheEnterprise.pdf).

Don't forget to visit Gregor's [blog](https://architectelevator.com/blog/). This is an older [website](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/), but still very useful. 

#### Some books

[Just Enough Software Architecture: A Risk-Driven Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Enough-Software-Architecture-Risk-Driven/dp/0984618104)
